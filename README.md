# atst_aa_rev01a

Changes from (previous repository's) branch testing-aa
have been brought forward to be merged; the results are
now On branch master.

Thus, branch master has a functioning LED blinkie.

Moving forward, branch testing-aa is retired.  New program
development will be on branch testing-bb.

Current program is good for the Adafruit Feather M0 Express,
their CPX and Metro M0 Express (most likely will function
with any ATSAMD21G18-AU board that has a traditional D13 LED
mapped onto PA17).
