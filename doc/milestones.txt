     branch testing-dd:

     * blue and cyan alternating Dotstar pattern - working demo.

     * continues to flicker the D13 LED after setting up the dotstars,
       every so often.

     Dotstar is APA102

     Remember to send MSB (most significant bit) first, and LSB, last.

     [START][BRIGHT][BLUE][GREEN][RED] ... [BRIGHT][BLUE][GREEN][RED][END]

     [START] is 32 zeros clocked in as data.
     [END]   is 32 ones  clocked in as data.
     [BRIGHT] is clocked in as three guard bits (all ones),
              followed by five brightness bits (MSB first).
     [BLUE] [GREEN] [RED] are each an 8-bit value.

     The whole 8x (Pimoroni Blinkt) is therefore:

     [START=32] + (([BRIGHT=3+5=8] + [BGR=24] x 8)=256) + [END=32]

     256 + 64 = 320 bits per 8x Dotstar circuit board (Pimoroni Blinkt)

END.
