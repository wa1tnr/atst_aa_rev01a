These instructions are mainly for the novice who does not
know how to 'git checkout my_branch' (on their local machine,
at the command line).

The SAMD21 program is currently functional 'on branch testing-aa'
rather than 'on branch master' (use 'git status' to verify the
current working branch, once the repository has been cloned to
you local hard disk drive).


Clone - Compile - Install
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 $ git clone https://github.com/wa1tnr/atst_aa_rev0.git 

 $ cd atst_aa_rev0

 $ git checkout testing-aa 

 $ cd ./gcc

 $ make clean
 $ make

 # double-click to get steady green RGB and pulsing red LEDs on target board

 $ make install  # requires Arduino IDE for its BOSSAC



 Supplementary information follows.


                - - - - -


 $ cat gcc/scripts/_bossac_local.sh 
#!/bin/sh

# call with one argument - the path/file.bin (not .uf2) to upload using bossac

if ! [ $1 ]; then
   echo no args.  Exiting; fi
   ~/.arduino15/packages/arduino/tools/bossac/1.7.0/bossac \
    -i -d --port=/dev/ttyACM0 -U true -i -e -w -v ${1} -R  # .bin not .elf

exit 0

Change the path in _bossac_local.sh to point to your bossac,
if it is different.

Note that the Makefile itself provides the name of the .bin file
that's passed on to bossac:

 $ cat -n gcc/Makefile | sed 205q | tail -2
   204  install:
   205          ./scripts/_bossac_local.sh ./AtmelStart.bin
 $
